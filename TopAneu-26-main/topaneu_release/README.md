# TopAneu Training Data README

Website: https://topaneu-26.grand-challenge.org/

The TopAneu data contains processed 3D angiographic brain scans and accompanying aneurysm annotations for multimodal vessel-specific intracranial aneurysm analysis.

## Data Release

The TopAneu training data has been released in two batches. The first batch of training data was released on June 15th 2026, which contained 40 MRA cases from center-2 and 58 CTA cases from center-4. On July 31st 2026, the second batch was released, which added 200 MRA cases from center-1, 47 CTA cases from center-2, four longitudinal CTA cases from center-4, and 68 MRA cases from the public center-5.

In total, the TopAneu training dataset contains 417 scans from 409 unique patients.

The center IDs correspond to the following data sources:

| Source                                      | Country / Type | Center ID (4) | Modalities(2) | # Patients (417)|
|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------|:--------------|:--------------|----------------:|
| Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV)         | Switzerland    | center-1      | MRA           |      200        |
| Geneva University Hospitals (HUG)           | Switzerland    | center-2      | CTA, MRA      |       87        |
| Mie Chuo Medical Center                     | Japan          | center-4      | CTA           |       54        |
| Public datasets: INSTED and OpenNeuro       | Public data    | center-5      | MRA           |       68        |

Data from center-3 (University Medical Center Utrecht, UMCU) are reserved for the test set and are not included in the released training data.

The center-5 data are derived from two public datasets:

- 32 cases from INSTED[1] with identifiers beginning with `0xx`. Patients with rare aneurysm locations were selected to enrich the classes in our dataset.
- 36 cases from the Lausanne TOF-MRA aneurysm cohort on OpenNeuro[2] with identifiers beginning with `4xx`.

*NOTE:* The vessel segmentations were predicted by an in-house model developed by the TopBrain UZH organizers. It borrows ideas and findings from the TopBrain 2025 summary, which is available on the [medRxiv preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.05.28.26354312). More information on the TopBrain vessel annotation and model can be found in the [TopBrain V2 challenge](https://topbrain2026.grand-challenge.org/).

**Mapping of aneurysm location:**

The `location_masks` and `location_jsons` folders contain multiclass aneurysm annotations. Each value corresponds to an aneurysm assigned to a specific anatomical aneurysm-location class.

*NOTE:* Since the batch-2 release, we added a new aneurysm location class, M1 early bifurcation, to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) anatomy. Now MCA has four location labels: M1 trunk, M1 early bifurcation, M1-M2 junction, and distal M2M3. (The list of images with updated locations, along with other quality control updates from batch-1, can be found in `CHANGELOG.txt`.)
